## Our system (Venter) and its objective

* **Support from community**: Through better organization of complaints, every complaint is seen through the lens of community of citizens with the same issue and hence reflecting the severity of the problem. 
* **Auto-generated solution**: Propose a solution for quick turn-around which may or may not be a solution, but can help remove human from the loop to some extent.
* **Ridiculously-low time to file a complaint**: We understand you are busy. With the help of several Machine Learning/Information Extraction techniques, we attempt to reduce the avaerage time to file an issue. 
* **Agencies in the loop**: The complaint resolving authorities are in the loop and are notified of issues of their concern.
